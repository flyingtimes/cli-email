# PRD: Email Priority Manager

## Executive Summary

A Python command-line tool that connects to email services via SMTP to intelligently classify and manage emails based on urgency and importance. The system uses SQLite for local data storage, BigModel.cn for AI-powered natural language processing, and provides comprehensive email management with attachment organization and priority-based workflow optimization.

## Problem Statement

Professionals receive overwhelming volumes of email daily, making it difficult to prioritize effectively. Critical messages from supervisors, department management, or those containing performance-related information often get lost in the inbox flood. Current email clients lack intelligent prioritization based on sender hierarchy, content analysis, and time sensitivity, leading to missed opportunities and delayed responses to important communications.

## User Stories

### Primary User: chenguangming@gd.chinamobile.com

**As a professional email user, I need to:**

1. **Email Classification**
   - Automatically classify emails by urgency (received within 48 hours)
   - Identify important emails from supervisors and management
   - Detect performance-related content (evaluation, promotion, benefits, registration)

2. **Local Management**
   - Store and manage all email data locally using SQLite
   - Organize attachments in a structured attachment library
   - Search and retrieve emails using natural language queries

3. **Command Line Interface**
   - Interact with email system through intuitive CLI
   - Perform email operations without leaving the terminal
   - Access AI-powered email analysis and summarization

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Email Management**
- SMTP connection to email provider using authorization codes
- Email retrieval and parsing from chenguangming@gd.chinamobile.com
- Automatic classification based on:
  - **Urgent**: Emails received within 48 hours
  - **Important**: From liangxiaoming3@gd.chinamobile.com or @chinamobile.com management
  - **Critical**: Content containing evaluation, performance, promotion, benefits, or registration keywords
- Email content conversion to Markdown format
- Attachment extraction and organized storage

**Database & Storage**
- SQLite database for email metadata and content
- Structured file system for attachment library
- Email indexing for fast search and retrieval
- Local data persistence with backup capabilities

**AI Integration**
- BigModel.cn API integration for natural language processing
- Email content summarization and analysis
- Natural language query interface for email search
- Priority scoring based on AI content analysis

**Command Line Interface**
- Interactive CLI for email management operations
- Commands for email classification, search, and retrieval
- Natural language query processing
- Attachment management commands
- Configuration management

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Fast email retrieval and classification (< 30 seconds for 100 emails)
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Responsive CLI with immediate feedback

**Security**
- Secure storage of email credentials and authorization codes
- Encrypted local data storage for sensitive information
- Secure API communication with BigModel.cn
- No cloud storage of email content - everything remains local

**Reliability**
- Robust error handling for network connectivity issues
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- Data integrity protection for email database
- Recovery mechanisms for corrupted data

**Usability**
- Intuitive command-line interface with clear help text
- Natural language queries that understand user intent
- Clear visual indication of email priority levels
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- **Classification Accuracy**: 95% accuracy in identifying urgent and important emails
- **Search Performance**: < 2 seconds response time for natural language queries
- **Processing Speed**: 100 emails processed and classified in under 30 seconds
- **User Satisfaction**: 90% reduction in time spent managing email prioritization

### Key Metrics
- Email classification precision and recall rates
- Query response time distribution
- User interaction frequency and patterns
- System resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage)

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.8+ compatibility required
- Windows environment support
- SQLite database limitations (single user, no concurrent write operations)
- BigModel.cn API rate limits and availability
- SMTP provider compatibility and security requirements

### Business Constraints
- Single user focus (chenguangming@gd.chinamobile.com)
- Local-only deployment (no cloud services)
- Limited development timeline and resources
- Integration with existing email infrastructure

### Assumptions
- Email provider supports SMTP with authorization code authentication
- BigModel.cn API provides reliable natural language processing capabilities
- User has basic familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Adequate local storage for email database and attachments
