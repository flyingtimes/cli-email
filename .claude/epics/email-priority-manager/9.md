advanced AI services for natural language processing, email summarization, and enhanced priority scoring. This integration will leverage BigModel.cn's language models to improve classification accuracy and provide intelligent email analysis.

## Requirements

### Natural Language Processing
- **Text Analysis**: Advanced understanding of email content and context
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detect emotional tone and urgency indicators
- **Entity Recognition**: Identify key entities (people, projects, deadlines)
- **Language Understanding**: Support both Chinese and English emails
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain context across email threads

### Email Summarization
- **Executive Summary**: Generate concise summaries for management emails
- **Action Items**: Extract specific tasks and deadlines from emails
- **Key Points**: Identify most important information in long emails
- **Thread Summaries**: Provide overviews of entire email conversations
- **Custom Length**: Adjustable summary length based on user needs

### Enhanced Priority Scoring
- **Semantic Understanding**: Deep analysis of email meaning and intent
- **Relationship Mapping**: Understand relationships between senders and recipients
- **Business Impact**: Assess business importance of email content
- **Deadline Detection**: Advanced identification of time constraints
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provide AI confidence levels for analyses

### API Integration
- **BigModel.cn API**: Connect to BigModel.cn's language model services
- **Rate Limiting**: Handle API quotas and rate limits effectively
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API failures
- **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching to reduce API calls
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: API Integration
1. Set up BigModel.cn API connection and authentication
2. Implement basic text analysis endpoint integration
3. Create error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Build API quota management system

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. Implement email summarization functionality
2. Add sentiment and entity analysis
3. Create enhanced priority scoring algorithms
4. Integrate with existing classification engine

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add thread-level analysis capabilities
2. Implement relationship mapping features
3. Create advanced caching and optimization
4. Add user feedback integration for AI improvement

## Technical Specifications

### API Components
- **BigModelClient**: Main API interface client
- **TextAnalyzer**: Text analysis and processing
- **EmailSummarizer**: Email summarization engine
- **PriorityEnhancer**: AI-enhanced priority scoring
- **CacheManager**: Intelligent caching system

### AI Models Integration
- **Text Classification**: Content categorization and topic detection
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identify people, projects, deadlines
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Emotional tone and urgency detection
- **Text Generation**: Summary and insight generation
- **Semantic Search**: Find related emails and content

### Database Integration
- Store AI analysis results in `ai_analysis` table
- Update enhanced priority scores in `email_priorities` table
- Track API usage and performance in `ai_usage_stats` table
- Cache AI results in `ai_cache` table

### Performance Optimization
