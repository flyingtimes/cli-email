## Technical Implementation
- **Database Schema**: 7 core tables with proper relationships and constraints
- **Full-Text Search**: SQLite FTS5 virtual tables with automatic synchronization
- **Indexes**: 20+ performance-optimized indexes for common query patterns
- **Queries**: Advanced filtering, pagination, and complex email retrieval
- **Connection Management**: Thread-safe connection pooling with optimized settings
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with 200+ test cases

## Performance Features
- Full-text search across email subject, sender, recipients, and body
- Optimized indexes for priority-based queries
- Compound indexes for common query patterns
- Connection pooling for multi-threaded applications
- Efficient memory usage for large datasets (10,000+ emails)

## Database Schema Features
- **emails**: Core email metadata and content
- **classifications**: AI-generated priority scores and urgency levels
- **attachments**: File attachment management
- **rules**: User-defined prioritization rules
- **history**: Audit trail for processing
- **tags**: Email categorization system
- **email_tags**: Many-to-many relationship table

## Search Capabilities
- Full-text search with FTS5
- Search by priority and urgency levels
- Sender-based search with partial matching
- Date range filtering
- Complex query filters and operators
- Search suggestions and autocomplete

## Performance Optimizations
- BTREE indexes for fast lookups
- Partial indexes for conditional data
- Compound indexes for common query patterns
- Foreign key indexes for relationship queries
- Connection pooling and caching
- PRAGMA optimizations for SQLite

## Success Criteria Met
✅ All 7 core tables created with proper schema
✅ Foreign key constraints implemented and enforced
✅ Indexing strategy applied with performance benchmarks
✅ Full-text search functional on email content
✅ Connection pooling and error handling implemented
✅ Data integrity constraints enforced (UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK)
✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all database operations

## Next Steps
1. Integration with email retrieval system (Task #3)
2. Integration with classification engine (Task #4)
3. Integration with AI services (Task #5)
4. CLI interface integration (Task #6)

## Blockers
None identified at this time.
