- Colored console output with file logging support
- Performance timing and metrics tracking
- Command execution logging
- Configurable log levels and output destinations

### ✅ Validation & Error Handling
- Input validation for emails, dates, file paths
- Custom validation framework
- Graceful degradation for optional features
- User-friendly error messages with guidance
- Exception handling with stack traces in debug mode

### ✅ Output Formatting
- Multiple output formats (table, JSON, CSV, Markdown)
- Rich table formatting with colors and borders
- Progress bars and status indicators
- Consistent message formatting (success, error, warning, info)

## Technical Architecture

### Framework Design
- **Click-based**: Uses industry-standard Click framework for CLI
- **Rich Integration**: Beautiful terminal output with Rich library
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns with clear module boundaries
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new commands and features
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Key Classes
- **CommandContext**: Context management for command execution
- **BaseCommand**: Base class for all CLI commands
- **ProgressManager**: Advanced progress tracking system
- **HelpSystem**: Comprehensive help documentation system
- **OutputFormatter**: Multi-format output generation

### Decorators and Utilities
- **@with_context**: Automatic context injection
- **@with_progress**: Progress tracking decorators
- **Validation functions**: Email, date, and file path validation
- **Color management**: Terminal color support with detection
