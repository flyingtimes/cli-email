## Overview

Implement a sophisticated natural language query interface that allows users to search and retrieve emails using conversational language queries. This system will leverage BigModel.cn's AI capabilities to understand user intent, parse complex queries, and provide intelligent email search results with context-aware responses.

## Requirements

### Natural Language Processing
- **Intent Recognition**: Understand user search intent from natural language queries
- **Query Parsing**: Convert conversational queries into structured search parameters
- **Context Understanding**: Maintain context across multi-turn conversations
- **Multi-language Support**: Handle both Chinese and English queries
- **Semantic Search**: Go beyond keyword matching to understand meaning

### Query Capabilities
- **Temporal Queries**: "emails from last week", "meetings tomorrow"
- **Sender/Recipient Queries**: "emails from John", "messages to the team"
- **Content Queries**: "emails about budget", "discussions on project timeline"
- **Priority Queries**: "urgent emails", "high priority messages"
- **Attachment Queries**: "emails with PDF attachments", "documents about contract"

### Search Features
- **Full-text Search**: Comprehensive search across email content, subject, and metadata
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handle typos and approximate matches
- **Faceted Search**: Filter by sender, date range, priority, attachments
- **Relevance Scoring**: AI-powered relevance ranking of results
- **Query Suggestions**: Provide intelligent query completion and suggestions

## Technical Implementation

### Query Processing Pipeline
1. **Query Analysis**: Parse and understand natural language input
2. **Intent Extraction**: Identify search intent and parameters
3. **Query Transformation**: Convert to structured search query
4. **Database Search**: Execute optimized database queries
5. **Result Ranking**: Apply AI-powered relevance scoring
6. **Response Generation**: Format and present results conversationally

### BigModel.cn Integration
- **Query Understanding**: Use BigModel.cn for natural language comprehension
- **Query Expansion**: Generate related terms and concepts
- **Result Summarization**: Provide concise summaries of search results
- **Follow-up Questions**: Suggest relevant follow-up queries
- **Feedback Learning**: Improve accuracy based on user interactions

### Database Integration
- Optimize SQLite queries for natural language search
- Implement full-text search with proper indexing
- Create views for common query patterns
- Add caching for frequently executed queries
- Support complex query combinations and filters

### User Interface
- **Command Line Interface**: Natural language query input via CLI
- **Interactive Mode**: Multi-turn conversations for complex searches
- **Result Formatting**: Clear, readable presentation of search results
- **Query History**: Maintain search history for quick access
- **Export Options**: Export results in various formats

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Query Processing
1. Implement natural language query parser
2. Create query transformation engine
3. Build database search optimization
4. Develop basic result ranking system

### Phase 2: AI Integration
1. Integrate BigModel.cn for query understanding
2. Implement semantic search capabilities
3. Add query expansion and suggestion features
4. Create result summarization functionality

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Implement conversational search interface
2. Add multi-turn conversation support
3. Create query learning and improvement system
4. Develop performance optimization and caching

## Technical Specifications

### Components
- **QueryProcessor**: Main query parsing and processing engine
- **IntentAnalyzer**: Extracts search intent from natural language
- **SearchEngine**: Optimized database search interface
- **ResultRanker**: AI-powered result ranking system
- **ConversationalInterface**: Multi-turn conversation manager

### Database Schema Extensions
