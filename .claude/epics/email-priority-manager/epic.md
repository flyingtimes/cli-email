# Epic: Email Priority Manager

## Overview

A Python-based command-line email management system that intelligently classifies emails by urgency and importance using SMTP integration, SQLite storage, and BigModel.cn AI services. The system provides local email management with natural language query capabilities and automated priority-based workflow optimization.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
- **Python 3.8+**: Primary language with rich email and CLI libraries
- **SQLite**: Local database for email metadata and content storage
- **BigModel.cn**: AI-powered natural language processing and email analysis
- **Standard Library**: imaplib, smtplib, sqlite3, argparse, click
- **Security**: Local credential encryption, no cloud data storage

### Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: For database operations and email storage
- **Strategy Pattern**: For email classification algorithms
- **Command Pattern**: For CLI command structure
- **Observer Pattern**: For email processing events and logging

### Key Technical Decisions
- **SQLite over full DBMS**: Single-user, local-only deployment
- **CLI-first approach**: Terminal-based interaction for efficiency
- **Markdown email format**: Structured content storage and readability
- **Attachment library**: Filesystem-based organization with database references
- **Modular architecture**: Separate concerns for email, classification, AI, and UI

## Technical Approach

### Core Components

#### Email Management Layer
- **SMTP/IMAP Client**: Connect to email provider using authorization codes
- **Email Parser**: Extract metadata, content, and attachments
- **Email Classifier**: Implement urgency/importance classification rules
- **Attachment Manager**: Extract and organize attachments in structured library

#### Database Layer
- **SQLite Schema**: Design normalized tables for emails, attachments, classifications
- **Search Index**: Full-text search capabilities for email content
- **Backup System**: Automated database backup and recovery
- **Performance Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization

#### AI Integration Layer
- **BigModel.cn Client**: API wrapper for natural language processing
- **Content Analyzer**: Email summarization and keyword extraction
- **Query Processor**: Natural language to SQL query translation
- **Priority Scorer**: AI-enhanced email priority calculation

#### CLI Interface Layer
- **Command Framework**: Interactive CLI with subcommands
- **Natural Language Interface**: Query processing and response generation
- **Configuration Manager**: Secure credential and settings storage
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time feedback for long operations

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- Database schema design and implementation
- Basic SMTP/IMAP email retrieval
- CLI framework setup
- Configuration management system

#### Phase 2: Classification Engine (Week 3-4)
- Priority classification algorithms
- Content analysis and keyword detection
- Sender hierarchy identification
- Time-based urgency calculation

#### Phase 3: AI Integration (Week 5-6)
- BigModel.cn API integration
- Natural language query processing
- Email summarization and analysis
- Enhanced priority scoring

#### Phase 4: User Interface (Week 7-8)
- Advanced CLI commands
- Natural language interface
- Attachment management
- Search and retrieval optimization
