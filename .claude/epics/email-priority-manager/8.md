# Classification Engine

## Overview
Build an intelligent email classification system that analyzes emails based on urgency (48-hour window), importance (management senders), and content analysis (performance-related keywords). The engine will generate priority scores and categorize emails for efficient processing.

## Requirements

### Priority Classification
- **Urgency Detection**: Identify emails requiring response within 48 hours
- **Importance Scoring**: Detect emails from management and key stakeholders
- **Content Analysis**: Identify performance-related keywords and topics
- **Composite Scoring**: Combine multiple factors into unified priority score
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjustable scoring thresholds based on user feedback

### Classification Categories
1. **High Priority**: Urgent + Important (respond within 4 hours)
2. **Medium Priority**: Important but not urgent (respond within 24 hours)
3. **Low Priority**: Neither urgent nor important (respond within 48 hours)
4. **Informational**: For reference only (no response required)
5. **Spam/Junk**: Filter out unwanted emails

### Analysis Features
- **Sender Analysis**: Identify management levels and importance
- **Temporal Analysis**: Detect urgency from time-sensitive language
- **Content Classification**: Categorize by topic (performance, project, administrative, etc.)
- **Thread Analysis**: Consider email thread history and context
- **Attachment Analysis**: Factor in attachment importance and type

### Machine Learning
- **Training Data**: Build labeled dataset from historical emails
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features for classification
- **Model Training**: Train classifiers for different priority aspects
- **Continuous Learning**: Update models based on user feedback
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provide confidence levels for classifications

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Rule-Based Classification
1. Implement keyword-based urgency detection
2. Create sender importance mapping
3. Build temporal analysis for 48-hour window
4. Develop basic composite scoring algorithm

### Phase 2: Machine Learning Integration
1. Prepare training data from existing emails
2. Implement feature extraction pipeline
3. Train initial classification models
4. Add confidence scoring and uncertainty handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Implement thread analysis and context awareness
2. Add user feedback integration
3. Create continuous learning system
4. Build performance monitoring and optimization

## Technical Specifications

### Core Components
- **PriorityAnalyzer**: Main classification orchestrator
- **UrgencyDetector**: Time-sensitive content analysis
- **ImportanceScorer**: Sender and authority analysis
- **ContentClassifier**: Topic and keyword analysis
- **ScoreAggregator**: Combines multiple scores into final priority

### Machine Learning Models
- **Urgency Classifier**: Binary classification for urgent/not urgent
- **Importance Classifier**: Multi-class for sender importance
- **Topic Classifier**: Multi-class for content categorization
- **Priority Regressor**: Continuous priority score prediction

### Database Integration
- Store classification results in `email_classifications` table
- Update classification confidence in `classification_confidence` table
- Track user feedback in `classification_feedback` table

### Algorithms
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text analysis and feature extraction
- **Temporal Analysis**: Time-based urgency calculation
- **Graph Analysis**: Email thread and relationship analysis
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple classification approaches

## Success Criteria

1. **Accuracy**: >90% classification accuracy on test data
2. **Precision**: <5% false positive rate for high priority
3. **Recall**: <10% false negative rate for urgent emails
4. **User Satisfaction**: >80% user agreement with classifications
5. **Performance**: <1 second classification time per email

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Individual classifier testing
- Feature extraction testing
- Score aggregation testing
- Edge case handling

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end classification pipeline
- Database integration testing
- Performance benchmarking

### User Acceptance Tests
- Classification accuracy validation
- User feedback integration
- Threshold tuning effectiveness

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: Secure handling of email content
2. **Access Control**: Limit classification system access
3. **Audit Trail**: Log all classification decisions
4. **Bias Detection**: Monitor for unfair classification patterns
5. **Explainability**: Provide reasoning for classification decisions

## Monitoring & Observability

- Classification accuracy metrics
- False positive/negative rates
- User feedback analysis
- Model performance drift
- System response times
- Resource utilization monitoring
