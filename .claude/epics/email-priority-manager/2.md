## Overview

Design and implement a comprehensive SQLite database schema to store email data, attachments, classifications, and priority information. The database will serve as the foundation for the email priority management system.

## Requirements

### Core Entities
- **Emails**: Store email metadata, content, and headers
- **Attachments**: Manage file attachments with metadata
- **Classifications**: Store AI-generated classifications and priority scores
- **Rules**: Maintain user-defined filtering and prioritization rules
- **History**: Track processing history and audit trail

### Schema Design Principles
- Normalize data to reduce redundancy
- Use appropriate data types and constraints
- Implement proper indexing for performance
- Support full-text search capabilities
- Include timestamps for audit purposes

## Technical Implementation

### Database Initialization
- Create SQLite database with proper schema
- Implement migration system for schema changes
- Add connection pooling and error handling
- Set up proper transaction management

### Tables to Design
1. **emails**: Core email data
2. **attachments**: File attachment information
3. **classifications**: AI classification results
4. **rules**: User-defined prioritization rules
5. **history**: Processing audit trail
6. **tags**: Email tagging system
7. **email_tags**: Many-to-many relationship table

### Indexing Strategy
- Primary keys on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for relationships
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Full-text search indexes on email content

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints
- Unique constraints where appropriate
- Check constraints for data validation
- Cascade delete/update rules

## Deliverables

### Schema Files
- Database initialization script
- Migration scripts for schema evolution
- Database utility functions
- Connection management module

### Documentation
- Complete schema documentation
- Entity relationship diagram
- Migration procedures
- Performance considerations

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tables created with proper schema
- [ ] Relationships and constraints implemented
- [ ] Indexing strategy applied
- [ ] Full-text search enabled
- [ ] Migration system functional
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Data integrity enforced
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Notes

- Consider SQLite-specific optimizations
- Plan for future schema extensions
- Include backup and recovery procedures
- Document data retention policies
